# AppSidebar Component Architecture

## Overview

The AppSidebar component has been refactored to follow best practices for React component design:

1. **Component Composition**: Breaking down the large component into smaller, focused components
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Completely separating styling from component logic
3. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has a single responsibility
4. **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable
5. **Maintainability**: Code is organized in a way that makes it easy to maintain

## Component Structure

### Main Components

- **AppSidebar**: The main container component that orchestrates all sub-components
- **SidebarHeader**: Displays the header with the app title and toggle button
- **SidebarTabs**: Displays the navigation tabs for different sections
- **FilesList**: Displays the list of uploaded files with actions
- **PromptSection**: Displays the saved prompts with actions
- **SettingsSection**: Displays the settings options
- **SidebarOverlay**: Displays an overlay when the sidebar is open on mobile

## Style Architecture

All styles have been moved to a dedicated style utility file:

- **sidebarStyles.ts**: Contains all style utilities and the `getSidebarStyles` function

## Usage

```tsx
import AppSidebar from './components/sidebar/AppSidebar';

// In your component
<AppSidebar
  uploadedFiles={uploadedFiles}
  onFileClick={handleFileClick}
  onPromptClick={handlePromptClick}
  onToggle={handleSidebarToggle}
  onFileAddToChat={handleFileAddToChat}
  onFileDelete={handleFileDelete}
/>
```

## Benefits

This refactoring provides several key benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller components are easier to maintain and test
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Performance**: Better control over component rendering and updates
4. **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features or modify existing ones

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Adding more customization options for the sidebar
2. Implementing virtualization for large lists
3. Adding animation options for transitions
4. Improving performance with memoization and optimized rendering
5. Adding support for more sidebar sections
