# AppSidebar Compatibility Fix

## Issue

After refactoring the AppSidebar component into smaller components and moving them to a dedicated folder, we encountered an error:

```
Error: Failed to read source code from /Volumes/workplace/AseekBotPOC/app/components/AppSidebar.tsx
Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

This occurred because the original file was removed, but other parts of the application were still importing from the original location.

## Solution

We implemented a compatibility layer to ensure that existing imports continue to work:

1. Created a new file at the original location (`app/components/AppSidebar.tsx`) that re-exports the new component:

```typescript
'use client';

// This is a compatibility file that re-exports the new AppSidebar component
// from its new location to maintain backward compatibility with existing imports.

import AppSidebar from './sidebar/AppSidebar';

// Re-export all the types and interfaces from the new component
export type { UploadedFile, AppSidebarProps } from './sidebar/AppSidebar';

export default AppSidebar;
```

2. Exported the necessary types and interfaces from the new component:

```typescript
export interface UploadedFile {
  // ...
}

export interface AppSidebarProps {
  // ...
}
```

3. Made sure all imports in the application continue to work without changes.

## Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
2. **Gradual Migration**: We can gradually update imports to use the new location
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Users of the component don't need to update their code immediately
4. **Clean Architecture**: We can still maintain a clean component architecture

## Next Steps

In the future, we can:

1. Update all imports to use the new location
2. Remove the compatibility layer once all imports have been updated
3. Document the new component structure for future developers
